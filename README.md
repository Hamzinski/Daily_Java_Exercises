# Daily Java Exercises

This project is created for my daily Java programming exercises. The aim is to improve Java programming skills, as well as algorithmic and problem-solving skills.

## Contents

A new exercise is added daily and stored regularly in the existing folder. The exercises cover a wide range of topics from basic Java concepts to advanced topics. Below is the file and folder structure where exercises are located:

daily_java_exercises/
│
├── day_1/
│ ├── Exercise1.java
│ └── Exercise2.java
│
├── day_2/
│ ├── Exercise1.java
│ └── Exercise2.java
│
└── ...

## How to Use

1. Clone this project to your local machine.
2. Each day, navigate to the corresponding folder (e.g., `day_1`, `day_2`) to find the exercises for that day.
3. Open the Java files in your preferred IDE or text editor.
4. Solve the exercises, following the instructions provided in the comments.
5. Test your solutions and make necessary adjustments.
6. Optionally, you can create branches or separate directories for each day's exercises to keep your work organized.
